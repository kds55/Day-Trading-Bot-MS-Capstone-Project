# Day-Trading-Bot-MS-Capstone-Project

Project represents a model built to day trade the stock markets. It uses extensive data feature creation and machine learning to predict the stock market direction over short periods of times.
It then uses this indicator to determine entry and exit points to produce a profit in the market.

I am currently enrolled in the Masters in Data Science program with an expected completion of October 16, 2023. At that time the project will be uploaded to this site. Sorry for any inconvience!
